1.	**APPROVAL DATE:**  March, 2016

2.	**SCOPE:**  This policy applies to grievance of the Senior Minister only.

3.	**POLICY**

    3.1.	Grievance Procedure for the Senior Minister:  If the Senior Minister has a grievance, it is discussed with the First Chair of the Board of Trustees.  If the grievance is not resolved, it is filed in writing on a Grievance Review Form (see “Grievance Review” in Personnel Forms section) and given to the Board of Trustees.  Copies of all grievances, appeals, evidentiary information, and decisions are placed in a separate file maintained by the Secretary of the Board.  No copies are filed in the Board minutes.

    3.2.	Unity Worldwide Ministries’ resources are available to the Senior Minister and Board when there is a dispute.  The Regional Representative and Unity Worldwide Ministries (UWM) staff can clarify policy.  If differences between the Senior Minister and Board are significant, consideration might be given to contacting UWM to discuss whether initiating a conflict transformation process might be appropriate.
