---



1.	**APPROVAL DATE:** November, 2015

2.	**RESOLUTION:** Unity of Fairfax supports the following statements of commitment to the church’s responsibility to the environmental future of our planet Earth.

    2.1.	**Paris Pledge**<br />
    In an act of solidarity with global leaders and nations at the 2015 UN Climate Talks in Paris, our faith community pledges to reduce its carbon pollution 50% by 2030 and to strive to become carbon neutral or 100% renewable energy powered by 2050.  We believe a brighter future is within reach - a world with an economy that works for people and the planet, a world safe from the ravages of climate change, a world with good jobs, clean air and water, healthy communities, and where people of faith everywhere act as stewards of Creation and begin to build a new relationship with the Earth.

    2.2.	**Unity Worldwide Ministries Resolution**<br />
    We, the leadership of Unity Worldwide Ministries, hear the urgent call to co-create a world that nourishes all life forms. We positively declare our love for and spiritual interconnectedness with all beings and our responsibility to protect the sustainability of the environment. Aligned with the empowering spiritual teachings of Unity co-founders Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, Jesus and other inspired spiritual teachers, we advocate our worldwide prayer partners to take into affirmative prayer and meditation the personal inquiry of “what is mine to do” to improve the quality of life of all beings and our planet. UWM affirms that climate change is real and that human activity is a significant cause of climate change. UWM also acknowledges that climate change is an issue resulting in both environmental degradation and social injustice. As such, we commit to serve, as our faith leads us, to take steps in healing the planet. Unity Worldwide Ministries, in accordance with its God-centered five basic principles, commits to advancing the Unity movement by:

        1. Promoting active stewardship of the environment and an awareness of our oneness with the earth.

        2. Cultivating a consciousness of EarthCare that includes both spiritual and practical actions that support and balance the environment and our human needs, in accordance with Unity’s Fifth Basic Principle, “Through thoughts, words and actions, we live the Truth we know.”

        3. Promoting sustainable living practices that honor the earth’s ecosystems and resources in a responsible manner.

        4. Transforming attitudes and commitments by embracing concrete actions that reduce human ecological impact and promote social justice for all.

        5. Educating, supporting and encouraging individuals to align their (individual) lifestyle choices with values that promote environmental sustainability and recognition of their moral imperative to care for creation.
