title: 'Honoring Diversity'
---


1.	**APPROVAL DATE:** October, 2015

2.	**SCOPE:** This policy applies to all programs, services, activities and decisions of Unity of Fairfax.

3.	**POLICY:** As a participating church within Unity Worldwide Ministries (UWM), Unity of Fairfax upholds the Joint Statements of Peace and Honoring Diversity from UWM and Unity World Headquarters, as follows:

3.1.	**Statement for Peace**
Unity stands for peace in the presence of conflict; for love in the presence of hatred; for forgiveness in the presence of injury. Unity honors the many names for God, the many paths to God, the many ways to worship God; for there is only one power and presence of God and that God loves each one of us equally. It is therefore the position of Unity Worldwide Ministries and Unity World Headquarters at Unity Village to urge all nations, their leaders and their people to turn to God by whatever the name for guidance during these challenging times and pursue peace, not war, for this is what honors the God of all our faith traditions. Unity stands for peace in our lifetime.

3.2.	**Honoring Diversity**
<p>We believe that all people are created with sacred worth. Therefore, we recognize the importance of serving all people within the Unity family in spiritually and emotionally caring ways. We strive for our ministries, publications and programs to reach out to all who seek Unity support and spiritual growth. It is imperative that our ministries and outreach be free of discrimination on the basis of race, color, gender, age, creed, religion, national origin, ethnicity, physical disability, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation. Our sincere desire is to ensure that all Unity organizations are nondiscriminatory and support diversity. </p>
<p>In our effort to reach out to all people as did our Way Shower, Jesus Christ, we support the modification of our facilities to make them accessible to all people, regardless of physical challenges; the translation of our materials into Braille and other languages; and respect for the wonderful variety of human commitments and relationships.</p>
<p>We encourage ministers, teachers and others within Unity to honor the strength of diversity within their spiritual communities. It is with love and in celebration of our unity, in the midst of our wondrous diversity, that we affirm this position.</p>
