title: 'Remote Attendance and Electronic Voting'
---


1.	APPROVAL DATE: November,  2018

2.	BACKGROUND

    2.1.	Unity of Fairfax desires to keep its technology and related practices up to date and deploy those practices consistent with our core values of inclusivity, love in action, spirit centered, peace, and integrity. Unity of Fairfax affirms Board participation that leverages technology to promote inclusivity, attracts as broad a range of Board members as possible, maximizes Board input, and maintains Board rapport, congeniality, and effectiveness.

    2.2.	Each Board member brings a valuable perspective to the Board. Using technology for remote participation can reduce the impact when a Board member cannot be physically present. We seek to meet in person when possible for all the benefits that provides. The remote participation and electronic voting policy creates agile ways for the Board to discharge its duties efficiently.

    2.3.	Additionally, although not necessary, Unity of Fairfax historically has attempted to harmonize its bylaws with those of Unity Worldwide Ministries (“UWM”). UWM’s bylaws permit Board and ministry teams to meet by telephone conference or other electronic communications that allow all participants to interact simultaneously. This policy follows though does not wholly duplicate that policy.

    2.4.	Accordingly, Unity of Fairfax affirms its desire to:

        2.4.1.	Use technology efficiently and intelligently;

        2.4.2.	Enhance its effectiveness and productivity;

        2.4.3.	Render Unity of Fairfax and its volunteer leadership roles appealing to modern generations;

        2.4.4.	Enable the Board of Trustees efficiently and effectively to address issues as they arise in a timely manner, which may often include matters that should be addressed before the next regularly-scheduled Board meeting;

        2.4.5.	Enhance inclusivity in Unity of Fairfax matters, which is a core Unity of Fairfax value;

        2.4.6.	Respect Board members’ dedication and commitment to their Board duties which drives their desire to participate in Board meetings even if out of the area or otherwise unable to attend due to unforeseen scheduling conflicts;

        2.4.7.	Enable representative participation (voices and perspectives) and allow for flexibility for the Board to fulfill its role with excellence and diversity of thought despite challenges that might arise from family, health, travel, business, weather, or other unforeseen conditions;

    2.5.	Allow for meaningful participation of:

        2.5.1.	Working adults to serve on the Board;

        2.5.2.	Adults with children or caregivers to serve on the Board;

        2.5.3.	Board members who may not, on account of health reasons, be able to participate in person;

        2.5.4.	Board members who may have requirements or opportunities to travel for business or personal reasons;

        2.5.5.	Allow for the Board to maintain its meeting schedule virtually in the event of inclement weather or other unavoidable issues (e.g., injuries, family emergencies, etc.);

        2.5.6.	Allow virtual participation of congregation members in alignment with the Unity of Fairfax practice of having open board meetings; and

        2.5.7.	Encourage and ensure willingness of qualified volunteers who bring the technical and leadership skills needed for effective Board functioning to become Board members.

3.	POLICY: Unity of Fairfax permits appropriate remote participation in regularly-scheduled Board meetings via technology that allows all Board members to hear and speak to each other. Unity of Fairfax permits electronic voting provided certain conditions are met, as set forth below.

    3.1.	REMOTE MEETING PARTICIPATION

        3.1.1.	Board Members are expected to attend all Board Meetings. Given competing priorities such as family, business, caregiving, and health, it is recognized that Board members may occasionally miss a Board Meeting. The bylaws limit the number of meetings each Board member may miss per year. This limit has been established in order to sustain continuity and information exchange. The Board meeting attendance requirement set forth in the bylaws remains in effect.

        3.1.2.	Board members and community members may attend regularly-scheduled Board meetings remotely through technology that allows all Board members to hear and speak to each other.

        3.1.3.	Though preferred, the technology chosen may or may not include video capabilities.

        3.1.4.	Board members attending a meeting remotely in accordance with this policy are considered “present” for all purposes.

        3.1.5.	Board members may exercise their sound discretion in deciding whether to attend a regularly-scheduled Board meeting remotely, balancing the five core values of Unity of Fairfax and any other factors the Board member deems appropriate.

        3.1.6.	Board members may not attend more than two consecutive regularly-scheduled Board meetings remotely, or more than three in any calendar year.

        3.1.7.	Board members must attend the January retreat in person.

    3.2.	ELECTRONIC VOTING: Action to be taken by the Board may be taken without a meeting if each Board member signs a consent describing the action to be taken and delivers it to the corporation. Such consent may be accomplished by one or more electronic transmissions. A consent so signed has the effect of action taken at a Board meeting and may be described as such in any document.
