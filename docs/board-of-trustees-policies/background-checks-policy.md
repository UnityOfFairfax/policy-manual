title: 'Background Checks Policy'
---


1.	DATE:  October 2018, by Rev. Russell Heiland, Sr. Minister

2.	PURPOSE
Unity of Fairfax seeks to ensure the safety of its volunteers while on duty (whether on or off premises), the safety of its constituents (staff and community) and the protection of its assets and reputation.  To reduce risks to our volunteers, staff, constituents and the organization, prospective and, as applicable, current staff and volunteers for certain position (namely, Board of Trustees, anyone working with minors, anyone providing one-on-one service in the name of Unity of Fairfax - e.g. Helping Hands, other volunteer positions as deemed warranted by the Board of Trustees) at Unity of Fairfax will undergo a background check that complies with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Volunteers are treated as applicants under the FCRA.

This policy sets forth guidelines for performing such background screens. Unity of Fairfax has selected an approved background screening provider, namely Protectmyministry.com. The Board of Trustees may, at its sole discretion, change the vendor providing background checks for all screenings or particular screenings, at its discretion.

Any questions or special considerations concerning this policy should be directed to the Senior Minister at Unity of Fairfax of the first chair of the Board of Trustees.

3.	SCOPE:  This policy applies to all prospective and current staff and designated volunteers with rescreens occurring every three years.

4.	POLICY

    4.1.	Disclosure and Authorization
    Selection, retention, and reassignment of applicants and volunteers are subject to meeting the requirements of a background screen.  In addition, all applicants/volunteers will be required to complete a Disclosure and Authorization form, which requests information that the approved background investigation provider requires to conduct the background screen.  The approved Disclosure and Authorization form allows Protectmyministry.com, or other duly approved vendor, to perform updates to the background check to the extent permitted by law.  After a period of three years, Unity of Fairfax will initiate a new background check (rescreen) with Protectmyministry.com, or other duly approved vendor, and a new authorization form will be completed by the volunteer or staff member.

    4.2.	Checks to be Conducted

        4.2.1.	The following reports will be obtained for time periods permitted by law for a background screen:

            4.2.1.1.	National Criminal Database: This includes OFAC and OIG/GSA search.

            4.2.1.2.	National Sex Offender Database: We go directly to all 50 states sex offender registry, at the state level. Instead of using the Dru Sjodin federal database, we go directly to the source of the data. This is done because it can take some time for the federal database to update with the information and 14 states do not report date of birth to that registry.

            4.2.1.3.	SSN verification: Validate that the SSN provided is accurate.

            4.2.1.4.	Address History: Our system pulls a list of addresses and alias names that are tied to the SSN.

            4.2.1.5.	Alias/Maiden Name Search: Using the information provided on the SSN Verification and Address History, we automatically submit any names tied to the SSN through the National Criminal Database and National Sex Offender Registry.

            4.2.1.6.	Re-Verification: When a report comes back with a record, the consumer reporting agency’s research team conducts our re-verification process on a background check before reporting it on the final report, insuring the accuracy of the report. Additional information on Protect My Ministry’s re-verification process can be found here, https://protectmyministry.com/background-checks/re-verification/.

        4.2.2.	 If warranted based on the position being considered, the following checks may be ordered from ProtectMyMinistry.com:

            4.2.2.1.	Motor Vehicle Record Check

            4.2.2.2.	Social Security Trace (SS Trace) - A Social Security Trace uses the applicant-provided social security number to find all reported address information for an individual over the last 7 years. The trace also finds all names used by the applicant – the given name as well as any alias/maiden names used. The information returned from the trace is then used to determine the name/court of record combinations that will be searched.

            4.2.2.3.	County/State Residence Criminal Search (Current) - The address entered during the background check order process is used to determine the county and state of residence (U.S.) for the volunteer. The search should look for any reported criminal history for the volunteer in that county or state at the primary source of information (the state or county courthouse).

            4.2.2.4.	County/State Search(es) – 7 Years of Address History - All counties/states in which the applicant has lived in the last 7 years should be identified. Those counties/states should be searched at the primary source of information (the state or county courthouse) using the name in question and other personally identifiable information.

            4.2.2.5.	Nationwide Criminal History Search with Validation - A Nationwide Criminal History search uses the full name and date of birth provided by the applicant during the order process to search over 900 criminal information data sources from all 50 states.

            4.2.2.6.	National 50 State Sex Offender Registry Search (Dru Sjodin/NSOPW) - The National 50 State Sex Offender Registry Search / National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW) is a comprehensive 50-state sex offender search – it is the only up-to-date, comprehensive source of sex offender information.

            4.2.2.7.	Alias/Maiden Name Search - An alias or maiden name is any name an individual has used at another time, in another place, or in another circumstance, for any reason. An alias/maiden name search should search those names provided during the screening order process as well as those names uncovered through an SSN Trace.

    4.3.	Disqualification Criteria
    The Senior Minister and relevant supervisor will review the report and determine if any negative information has a direct connection with an applicant’s ability to fulfill the applicant’s duties with competence and integrity, or that might impact safety.  Matters that might raise a concern include but are not limited to the following:

        4.3.1.	Criminal History Search
         A criminal conviction will not automatically prohibit an individual from volunteering at Unity of Fairfax, but will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  In some cases, statutes dictate the types of offenses that disqualify applicants from volunteering with certain organizations or in certain positions. Those lists will be referenced as well by Unity of Fairfax when making a decision regarding the applicant’s eligibility.
        For Example: In accordance with Virginia law regarding “Barrier Crimes,” convictions for the following categories of crimes are generally considered role-related when working with vulnerable populations including children, the disabled, and the elderly, and, therefore, will be considered in making decisions:

            4.3.1.1.	Any felony conviction – these serious crimes are usually defined by statutory guidelines, and in general, are punishable by more than 1-year incarceration.

                4.3.1.1.1.	Theft – including burglary, robbery, embezzlement, forgery, fraud.

                4.3.1.1.2.	Violent crimes – including murder, robbery, assault, battery.

                4.3.1.1.3.	Drug-related crimes – including use, sale, possession, distribution, or manufacture of illegal drugs.

                4.3.1.1.4.	Sex offenses – including rape and sexual assault.

                4.3.1.1.5.	Serious motor vehicle offenses – includes driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

            4.3.1.2.	Arrests that are not pending and did not result in conviction should not be considered. Arrests pending disposition that are role-related may be considered subject to state law.

            4.3.1.3.	Prior to making a decision regarding eligibility, Unity of Fairfax will validate, using approved identification (e.g. Driver’s license), that the background check was run using the same correct information.

            4.3.1.4.	Arrest information: Arrests that are disclosed within 48 hours pursuant to Unity of Fairfax policy or that are revealed during the background check process will not necessarily result in termination of application/employment/volunteer status but will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

        4.3.2.	Motor Vehicle Reports – This report can indicate that the applicant has a suspended or revoked license.  Further, serious motor vehicle violations such as Driving While Intoxicated, Driving Under the Influence, Driving While Ability Impaired or reckless driving may be relevant for all positions.


        4.3.3.	 Reference Interviews – These checks may reveal information that indicates an applicant is not an acceptable fit for Unity of Fairfax. Information gained in a reference interview will be carefully reviewed for any omissions or inaccuracies contained in the applicant’s application or made during the interview process.

    4.4.	Pre-Adverse Action and Adverse Action Based on Information in Background Check

        4.4.1.	Pre-Adverse Action – Unity of Fairfax will notify the applicant of a negative report BEFORE any adverse employment action is taken. If the consumer reporting agency reports information which may be used, in whole or in part, as a basis for an adverse action (e.g. denying applicant position), the applicant will receive notification before a final decision is made to deny the staff or volunteer role. This will provide the applicant with an opportunity to dispute the information in the consumer report directly with the consumer reporter agency. Unity of Fairfax will provide a copy of the consumer report, a pre-adverse action letter and another copy of the FCRA notice of rights.
        The applicant shall also receive any applicable state rights as required.

        4.4.2.	Waiting Period to Find Out What, if Any, Explanation is Offered by the Applicant
        If the applicant does not respond at all to the notification within a reasonable period of time (5 days), Unity of Fairfax may proceed with its decision to deny the position.  If the applicant responds, Unity of Fairfax will carefully consider the information submitted and then make a decision.  If the explanation is reasonable under the circumstances, then it may still be possible to go forward with hiring or onboarding (e.g. a case of mistaken identity). However, if the applicant's explanation is determined to be insufficient, then Unity of Fairfax will proceed to the next step, notification of Adverse Action.

    4.5.	Notification of Adverse Action – Unity of Fairfax will provide the applicant with written notice of the adverse action and the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency.

    4.6.	Equal Employment Laws
    Unity of Fairfax will adhere to all equal opportunity laws.  When reviewing any criminal record information that appears on a background check, Unity of Fairfax shall factor in any known factors relating to:

        4.6.1.	The facts and circumstances surrounding the offense

        4.6.2.	The number of offenses for which the individual was convicted

        4.6.3.	The age of the individual at the time of conviction or release from prison

        4.6.4.	Evidence that the individual has performed the same type of work, post-conviction, with the same or a different organization, without incidents of criminal conduct

        4.6.5.	Any efforts of the application towards rehabilitation.

        4.6.6.	Employment or character references obtained regarding the individual’s fitness for the particular position.

        4.6.7.	Whether the individual will be bonded for the position. 

    4.7.	Confidentiality

        4.7.1.	Unity of Fairfax assures all applicants that personal data and information collected from the background screening will not be used for purposes other than determining the eligibility and appropriateness to work in the specific role to which they are applying.

        4.7.2.	Unity of Fairfax assures all applicants that their personal information will be securely stored, and access available to only to those who have a need to know.

        4.7.3.	All documents related to the background screen process must be retained for at least five years.
