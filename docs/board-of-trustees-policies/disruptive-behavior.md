title: 'Disruptive Behavior'
---

1.	APPROVAL DATE:  September, 2018

2.	SCOPE:  While inclusivity is one of the core values of Unity of Fairfax and expressed in the principles held by Unity Worldwide Ministries, we affirm our belief that our congregation must maintain a secure atmosphere where such openness can exist.  When any person’s physical and/or emotional well-being or freedom to safely participate in this community is threatened, the source of this threat must be addressed firmly and promptly, even if this ultimately requires the expulsion of the offending person or persons.

3.	BACKGROUND:  Unity of Fairfax strives to be an inclusive community, affirming both our differences and our oneness;  however, concern for the safety and well-being of the congregation as a whole must be given priority over the privileges and inclusion of the individual.  To the degree the disruptive behavior compromises the health of this congregation, our actions as people of faith must reflect this emphasis on sacred safety and security.
There have been times when disruptive behavior of an individual in the church building or on the church grounds has led members to voice their concerns about one or more of the following:

    3.1.	Perceived threats to the safety of any adult or child;

    3.2.	The disruption of church activities;

    3.3.	Diminishing appeal of the congregation to its potential and existing membership.

4.	POLICY:  The following shall be the policy of Unity of Fairfax in dealing with these issues:

    4.1.	If an immediate response is required, this will be undertaken by the Minister(s), if available, and/or the leader of the group involved.  This may include asking the offending person or persons to leave, OR suspending the meeting or activity until such time that it may be safely resumed.  If further assistance is required, the Police Department may be called.  Anytime any of these actions are undertaken without the Minister(s), the Minister(s) must be notified; a follow-up letter detailing the offense and the action taken because of the offense, should be written and distributed to the Minister(s) and the Board Chair.

    4.2.	Situations not requiring immediate response will be referred to an ad hoc committee appointed by the Board.  The committee will respond in terms of their own judgment observing the following:

        4.2.1.	The committee will respond to problems as they arise.  There will be no attempt to define “acceptable” behavior in advance.

        4.2.2.	Persons identified as disruptive will be dealt with as individuals.  Stereotypes will be avoided.

        4.2.3.	The committee will collect all necessary information.

        4.2.4.	To aid in evaluating the problem, these points will be considered:

            4.2.4.1.	DANGEROUSNESS – Is the individual the source of a threat or perceived threat to persons or property?

            4.2.4.2.	DISTRUPTIVENESS – How much interference with church functions is going on?

            4.2.4.3.	OFFENSIVENESS – How likely is it that prospective or existing members will be driven away?

        4.2.5.	To determine the necessary response, these points will be considered:

            4.2.5.1.	CAUSES – Why is the disruption occurring?  Is it a conflict between the individual and others in the church?  Is it due to a professionally diagnosed condition or mental illness?

            4.2.5.2.	HISTORY – What is the extent, if any, of disruption cause in the past?

            4.2.5.3.	PROBABILITY OF CHANGE – How likely is it that the problem behavior will diminish in the future?

        4.2.6.	The committee will, after prayerful discernment, decide on the necessary response on a case by case basis.  However, three levels of action/response are recommended:

            4.2.6.1.	LEVEL ONE – The committee shall inform the Minister(s) of the problem and either the Minister(s) or a member/s of the committee shall meet with the offending person/s to communicate the concern.

            4.2.6.2.	LEVEL TWO – The offending individual/s is excluded from specific church activities for a limited period of time, with reasons and conditions of return written and made clear (with a copy going to the offender/s and one going into congregational files).

            4.2.6.3.	LEVEL ONE or LEVEL TWO action taken may be appealed to the Executive Session of the Board, and/or the Minister(s).

            4.2.6.4.	LEVEL THREE – The offending individual is permanently excluded from church premises and all church functions.  Before this is carried out, the committee will consult with the full Board and the Minister(s).  If it is agreed that the expulsion take place, a letter will be written and sent by the Minister, or a designated member of the Board if that is more appropriate, to the individual outlining expulsion, the individual’s rights, and any possible recourse.
